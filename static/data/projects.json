All of us in the team got to play our strengths and generally we had a good time. Also we got a 12 for our project."

My main project there was to gather all notifications a user would get in a single interface. This involved figuring out a user-journey, designing and then developing it. It took a lot of trial and error but I was really happy with how it turned out. Unfortunately its not possible to view the GrantOne application without being a customer, and the code is of course not available to the public."

The project was to create a booking application for residencies, similair to AirBNB. I had already started on my multimedia education, so there was a lot going on at the time. I remember quite well that I installed Bootstrap on the project, but couldnt quite figure out to get SASS installed so it could be customized. Therefore I thought it would be smart to take a shortcut and just try to style it directly with plain css. The result is a pretty janky styled website and serves as a reminder for me to not stress or rush into projects."
